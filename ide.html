                <h2>Style inspiration</h2>
                    <p>I took alot of inspiration from the game Space up!</p>
                    <p>I wanted a round ish chracter with a big head and cutenes factor, no shine in the eyes and depth using curved lines. Even the villain has the bouba effect with baby bias, because i wanted the game to be cute and simple.</p>
                    <p>I didn't use any of the original colours, because i wanted a nature feel instead of space. My design ended up being a little more flat then i had planed, which is a shame, but something I will think more about on my next project.</p>
                 <h2>Idea barinstorming</h2>
                    <p>I had a hard time coming up with a good idea, and alle the brainstorming tools and tricks from lectures wasn't helping. I ended up with a blank page just writing everything down I could come up with. </p>
                    <p>Some of my options where finding different objects (like a detective game), or click away things not belonging in a cooking bowl. And lastyly the idea with a border came to me. </p>
                <h2>The finale idea</h2>
                    <p>So my finale idea is this border control game</p>
                    <p>You help you crazy Scotish boss at the border by throwing an axe at people who should not cross, and of course Scothish people hate the english. So if you want to win, get as many of those bawbags as you can!</p>
